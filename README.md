# Data Engineering Systems Course - Polars Descriptive Statistics
[![CI](https://github.com/nogibjj/monasaeed-polars-descriptive-stats/actions/workflows/cicd.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nogibjj/monasaeed-polars-descriptive-stats/actions/workflows/cicd.yml)

Welcome to the repository for the third week of the Data Engineering Systems course at Duke University.

## Project Overview
This project utilizes the **Diamond Dataset** to perform descriptive statistics using **Polars**. It generates a comprehensive summary report, offering insights into the dataset's key attributes and statistical measures.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main script that performs data analysis, generates plots, and saves the summary report.
- `main_test.py`: The test script that contains unit tests for the functions defined in `main.py`.
- `diamonds_summary_report.md`: The Markdown file generated by the main script that contains summary statistics and plots.
- `carat_price_scatter_plot.png`: The scatter plot image saved by the script.
- `.devcontainer`: Configuration for a consistent development environment.
- `Makefile`: Automation of common tasks and commands.
- `.github`: GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required for the project.
